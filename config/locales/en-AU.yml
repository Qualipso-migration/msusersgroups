      tips:
        - Tags allow you to add key words to identify all your repository elements (Graphs,
          Documents, Resources, Roles) on a cross analytical axis.
        - For example, you can reference norms and norm's chapter on a graph or document
          as a tag.
        - You specify "Tags" on "Properties" page for each repository element.
